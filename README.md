# Webpacker::React [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/renchap/webpacker-react.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/renchap/webpacker-react)

Webpacker-React makes it easy to use [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) with [Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) in your Rails applications.

Important note: Webpacker is not yet officially released. It will be included in Rails 5.1 but is highly experimental for now.

An example application is available: https://github.com/renchap/webpacker-react-example/

This gem is a work in progress. Final feature list:

- [x] uses the new Webpacker way of integrating Javascript with Rails (using packs)
- [x] render React components from views using a `react_component` helper
- [x] render React components from controllers using `render react_component: 'name'`
- [x] support for [hot reloading](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)
- [ ] render components server-side
- [ ] use a Rails generator to create new components

## Installation

Your Rails application needs to use Webpacker and have the React integration done. Please refer to their documentation documentation for this: https://github.com/rails/webpacker/blob/master/README.md#ready-for-react

First, you need to add the webpacker-react gem to your Rails app Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'webpacker-react', "~>0.1.0"
```

Once done, run `bundler` to install the gem.

Then you need to update your `vendor/package.json` file to include the `webpacker-react` NPM module:
```json
  "dependencies": {
    "..."
    "webpacker-react": "~>0.1.0"
  },
```

Finally, run `./bin/yarn` to install the module. You are now all set!

### Note about versions

Webpacker-React contains two parts: a Javascript module and a Ruby gem. Both of those components respect [semantic versioning](http://semver.org). **When upgrading the gem, you need to upgrade the NPM module to the same minor version**. New patch versions can be released for each of the two independently, so it is ok to have the NPM module at version `A.X.Y` and the gem at version `A.X.Z`, but you should never have a different `A` or `X`.

## Usage

The first step is to register your root components (those you want to load from your HTML).
In your pack file (`app/javascript/packs/*.js`), import your components as well as `webpacker-react` and register them. Considering you have a component in `app/javascript/components/hello.js`:

```javascript
import Hello from 'components/hello'
import WebpackerReact from 'webpacker-react'

WebpackerReact.register(Hello)
WebpackerReact.initialize()
```

### With Turbolinks

You have to make sure Turbolinks is loaded before calling `WebpackerReact.initialize()`.

For example:

```javascript
import Hello from 'components/hello'
import WebpackerReact from 'webpacker-react'
import Turbolinks from 'turbolinks'

Turbolinks.start()
WebpackerReact.initialize()

WebpackerReact.register(Hello)
```

You may also load turbolinks in regular asset pipeline `application.js`:

```javascript
//= require "turbolinks"
```

In that case, make sure your packs are loaded *after* `application.js`

Now you can render React components from your views or your controllers.

### Rendering from a view

Use the `react_component` helper:

```erb
<%= react_component('Hello', name: 'React') %>
```

### Rendering from a controller

```rb
class PageController < ApplicationController
  def main
    render react_component: 'Hello', props: { name: 'React' }
  end
end
```

You can pass any of the usual arguments to render in this call: `layout`, `status`, `content_type`, etc.

*Note: you need to have [Webpack process your code](https://github.com/rails/webpacker#binstubs) before it is available to the browser, either by manually running `./bin/webpack` or having the `./bin/webpack-watcher` process running.*

### Hot Module Replacement

[HMR](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/) allows to reload / add / remove modules live in the browser without
reloading the page. This allows any change you make to your React components to be applied as soon as you save,
preserving their current state.

First, install `react-hot-loader`:

```
./bin/yarn add react-hot-loader@3.0.0-beta.6
```

You then need to update your Webpack config.

We provide a convenience function to add the necessary changes to your config if it's not
significantly different than the standard Webpacker config:

```js
//development.js
...

var configureHotModuleReplacement = require('webpacker-react/configure-hot-module-replacement')

var sharedConfig = require('./shared.js')
sharedConfig = configureHotModuleReplacement(sharedConfig)

module.exports = merge(sharedConfig, ...)
```

If you need to change your configuration manually:

1. set the public URL used to load `webpack-dev-server` assets
    ```js
    {
      output: {
        publicPath: 'http://localhost:8080'
      }
    }
    ```

2. add `react-hot-loader/babel` to your `babel-loader` rules:
    ```javascript
    {
    module: {
      rules: [
        {
          test: /\.jsx?(.erb)?$/,
          exclude: /node_modules/,
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            presets: [
              'react',
              [ 'latest', { 'es2015': { 'modules': false } } ]
            ],
            plugins: ['react-hot-loader/babel']
          }
        }
    }
    ```

3. prepend `react-hot-loader/patch` to your entries:
    ```javascript
    {
      entry:
        { application: [ 'react-hot-loader/patch', '../app/javascript/packs/application.js' ],
        ...
    }
    ```

4. you now need to use `webpack-dev-server` (in place of `webpack` or `webpack-watcher`). Make sure the following line is in your development.rb:
    ```ruby
    config.x.webpacker[:dev_server_host] = 'http://localhost:8080/'
    ```
and start `webpack-dev-server` in hot replacement mode:
    ```
    ./bin/webpack-dev-server --hot
    ```

5. finally opt in to HMR from your pack files:
    ```es6
    import SomeRootReactComponent from 'components/some-root-react-component'
    import WebpackerReact from 'webpacker-react/hmr'

    WebpackerReact.register(SomeRootReactComponent)
    if (module.hot)
      module.hot.accept('components/some-root-react-component', () =>
        WebpackerReact.renderOnHMR(SomeRootReactComponent) )
    ```

## Development

To work on this gem locally, you first need to clone and setup [the example application](https://github.com/renchap/webpacker-react-example).

Then you need to change the example app Gemfile to point to your local repository and run bundle afterwise:

```ruby
gem 'webpacker-react', path: '~/code/webpacker-react/'
```

Finally, you need to tell Yarn to use your local copy of the NPM module in this application, using [`yarn link`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/link):

```
$ cd ~/code/webpacker-react/javascript/webpacker_react-npm-module/
$ yarn
$ cd dist/
$ yarn             # compiles the code from src/ to dist/
$ yarn link
success Registered "webpacker-react".
info You can now run `yarn link "webpacker-react"` in the projects where you want to use this module and it will be used instead.
$ cd ~/code/webpacker-react-example/
$ yarn link webpacker-react
success Registered "webpacker-react".
```

After launching `./bin/webpack-watcher` and `./bin/rails server` in your example app directory, you can now change the Ruby or Javascript code in your local `webpacker-react` repository, and test it immediately using the example app.

## Testing

Make sure you run first:

```sh
$ test/example_app/bin/yarn
$ test/example_app/bin/webpack
```

And optionally:

```sh
$ cd test/example_app/vendor/
$ yarn link "webpacker-react"
```

Finally, run the test suite:

```sh
$ rake test
```

If you change the javascript code, please ensure there are no style errors:

```sh
$ cd javascript/webpacker_react-npm-module/
$ yarn lint
```

### Thanks

This gem has been inspired by the awesome work on [react-rails](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails) and [react_on_rails](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails/). Many thanks to their authors!
